# The Program
  This is a very ROUGH and quickly made program to handle scheduling of practice times for league play of CSGO 
on ESEA. The program itself isn't meant for ESEA, it is meant for teams to have an easier time scheduling things with
each other. The program is not finished and will be in development for a while due to time constraints.
I plan to have this console app done within the month (March '19) for myself and my team (hopefully) and eventually 
have a fully developed GUI for others to use by July '19. These are rough time lines that I expect to have things done,
this is of course assuming I have the privilege of working on them consistently throughout the year.

# Purpose
  One of the biggest problems I've encountered with my experience in ESEA league play is practice time scheduling.
Usually what happens is someone starts a group chat with WhatsApp and people communicate their availability with
each other there. The problem with this is it becomes difficult for the scheduler to handle everyone's available
times due to time zone differences or sudden changes in daily events. It becomes even more stressful when trying to
schedule a match time. Players have small constraints of needing an extra 30 mins or so for warm up or whatever they
need to prepare themselves before a match time. Creating a program to get around these little things has become my 
solution to solving this consistent problem I've had in every team I join. Other methods I've seen used are Google docs
or Excel spreadsheets. None of those were ever good solutions. I hope to remedy this problem with this program.
